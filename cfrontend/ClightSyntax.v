(** * Abstract syntax *)

(** ** Expressions *)

(** Clight expressions correspond to the "pure" subset of C expressions.
  The main omissions are string literals and assignment operators
  ([=], [+=], [++], etc).  In Clight, assignment is a statement,
  not an expression.  Additionally, an expression can also refer to
  temporary variables, which are a separate class of local variables
  that do not reside in memory and whose address cannot be taken.

  As in Compcert C, all expressions are annotated with their types,
  as needed to resolve operator overloading and type-dependent behaviors. *)

Inductive expr : Type :=
  | Econst_int: int -> type -> expr       (**r integer literal *)
  | Econst_float: float -> type -> expr   (**r double float literal *)
  | Econst_single: float32 -> type -> expr (**r single float literal *)
  | Econst_long: int64 -> type -> expr    (**r long integer literal *)
  | Evar: ident -> type -> expr           (**r variable *)
  | Etempvar: ident -> type -> expr       (**r temporary variable *)
  | Ederef: expr -> type -> expr          (**r pointer dereference (unary [*]) *)
  | Eaddrof: expr -> type -> expr         (**r address-of operator ([&]) *)
  | Eunop: unary_operation -> expr -> type -> expr  (**r unary operation *)
  | Ebinop: binary_operation -> expr -> expr -> type -> expr (**r binary operation *)
  | Ecast: expr -> type -> expr   (**r type cast ([(ty) e]) *)
  | Efield: expr -> ident -> type -> expr. (**r access to a member of a struct or union *)

(** [sizeof] and [alignof] are derived forms. *)

Definition Esizeof (ty' ty: type) : expr := Econst_int (Int.repr(sizeof ty')) ty.
Definition Ealignof (ty' ty: type) : expr := Econst_int (Int.repr(alignof ty')) ty.

(** Extract the type part of a type-annotated Clight expression. *)

Definition typeof (e: expr) : type :=
  match e with
  | Econst_int _ ty => ty
  | Econst_float _ ty => ty
  | Econst_single _ ty => ty
  | Econst_long _ ty => ty
  | Evar _ ty => ty
  | Etempvar _ ty => ty
  | Ederef _ ty => ty
  | Eaddrof _ ty => ty
  | Eunop _ _ ty => ty
  | Ebinop _ _ _ ty => ty
  | Ecast _ ty => ty
  | Efield _ _ ty => ty
  end.

(** ** Statements *)

(** Clight statements are similar to those of Compcert C, with the addition
  of assigment (of a rvalue to a lvalue), assignment to a temporary,
  and function call (with assignment of the result to a temporary).
  The three C loops are replaced by a single infinite loop [Sloop s1
  s2] that executes [s1] then [s2] repeatedly.  A [continue] in [s1]
  branches to [s2]. *)

Definition label := ident.

Inductive statement : Type :=
  | Sskip : statement                   (**r do nothing *)
  | Sassign : expr -> expr -> statement (**r assignment [lvalue = rvalue] *)
  | Sset : ident -> expr -> statement   (**r assignment [tempvar = rvalue] *)
  | Scall: option ident -> expr -> list expr -> statement (**r function call *)
  | Sbuiltin: option ident -> external_function -> typelist -> list expr -> statement (**r builtin invocation *)
  | Ssequence : statement -> statement -> statement  (**r sequence *)
  | Sifthenelse : expr  -> statement -> statement -> statement (**r conditional *)
  | Sloop: statement -> statement -> statement (**r infinite loop *)
  | Sbreak : statement                      (**r [break] statement *)
  | Scontinue : statement                   (**r [continue] statement *)
  | Sreturn : option expr -> statement      (**r [return] statement *)
  | Sswitch : expr -> labeled_statements -> statement  (**r [switch] statement *)
  | Slabel : label -> statement -> statement
  | Sgoto : label -> statement

with labeled_statements : Type :=            (**r cases of a [switch] *)
  | LSnil: labeled_statements
  | LScons: option Z -> statement -> labeled_statements -> labeled_statements.
                      (**r [None] is [default], [Some x] is [case x] *)

(** The C loops are derived forms. *)
